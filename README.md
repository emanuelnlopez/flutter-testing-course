# flutter-testing-course

Application developed while doing the [Flutter testing course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-testing-unit-widget-integration-testing) by [Richa HarSivo](https://harsivo.com/) on Udemy.

## Description

The more features your app has, the harder it is to test manually. Automated tests help ensure that your app performs correctly before you publish it, while retaining your feature and bug-fix velocity.

This course will cover all the basics you need to know for Flutter Testing. Once you learned this course you will be stronger in basics and you are all set to automate any flutter app.

You may have a working app, but you want to test changes you’re making to extend the app. Maybe you already have tests written, but aren’t sure whether they’re the right tests. Or, you have started working on a new app and want to test it as you go.

By the end of this video course, you will have a very clear understanding of how to write Flutter tests.

If you are a freelance developer you might postpone learning how to unit test the Flutter app for some time. But if you are planning to join a bigger team, then unit testing is a must-have skill for you to be able to work on important app features.

In this course, you will learn:
 - Introduction to testing
 - Unit Testing
 - Widget testing
 - Integration Testing
 - API Testing & Mocks

Generally speaking, a well-tested app has many unit and widget tests, tracked by code coverage, plus enough integration tests to cover all the important use cases. I hope you decide to take this course and upscale your skills for flutter testing!
